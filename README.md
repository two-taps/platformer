# pygame platformer game

![Game screenshot](/data/images/readmeMainImage.png)

This is a simple platformer game made with python 3.8.5 and using the pygame library.

It is about a fictionary character that gets into an underground factory. Through the game you need to beat many kind of obstacles and enemies in order to make it out of the underground world.

## Requirements

Just make sure you have pygame and numpy installed in your system. I have been using the last version of the developer pygame version which you can install by running:

`pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev10`

## Running the game

Simply go on the main folder of the project and run the following command:

`python game.py`
